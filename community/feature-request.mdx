## Shape the future with your ideas

AI Interview Buddy is a community-driven project.  

Many of our most useful features began as **suggestions from users like you** on [r/AiInterviewBuddy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AiInterviewBuddy/).

We listen to the community to decide:
- Which **new features** should be added next
- What problems are worth solving
- How to make the app more useful for real-world use cases

> ðŸ’¡ If something would make your experience better â€” suggest it! Weâ€™re building this together.

## How the process works

We follow a simple and transparent process to turn ideas into reality:

### 1. Discuss on Reddit

Start a new post or join an existing discussion on [r/AiInterviewBuddy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AiInterviewBuddy/) under the **Feature Request** flair.  

Explain your idea and how it would help. Other users can upvote, give feedback, or suggest improvements.

---

### 2. GitHub

Once a feature is clearly defined and validated through community feedback, weâ€™ll create a **GitHub issue** labeled `feature-request` for tracking.

This helps the dev team prioritize and plan implementation.

---

### 3. Contribute to building it

If you're a developer, you can help bring the feature to life!  

Check out our [Open Source Contribution Guide](/open-source/contributing) to get started.

---

### 4. Help test the feature

Once the feature is in development or beta, we need help testing it.

Head over to [Testing](/community/testing) to learn how you can provide feedback and ensure it works smoothly before release.
