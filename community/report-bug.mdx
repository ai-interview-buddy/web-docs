## How to report a bug

There are **two ways** you can report bugs:

### 1. Post on Reddit

Use [r/AiInterviewBuddy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AiInterviewBuddy/) and tag your post with the **Bug Report** flair.  

Please include:

- A clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- Screenshots or error messages (if available)
- Your device/browser/environment details

Community members and core developers can discuss and confirm the issue with you.

---

### 2. Open a GitHub issue

If you prefer to report it directly, go to our GitHub repository:  

🔗 [AI Interview Buddy GitHub – Issues](https://github.com/ai-interview-buddy/app-ai-interview-buddy/issues)

When creating a new issue:

- Use the **Bug report template**
- Provide all relevant details
- Label it with `bug`

This is the fastest path to get something added to our development backlog.
