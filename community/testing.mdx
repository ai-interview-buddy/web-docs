## Testing the App

To ensure AI Interview Buddy is stable, user-friendly, and production-ready, we run **multiple testing programs** before each release.

You can help us test upcoming features on both **Android** and **iOS**.

## Test Scenario: Sample Interview Audio

To help you test the app quickly, we've prepared a short audio clip from a real interview posted on YouTube:

[Watch the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_i2RETG0yo)

You can use this to test the app's core features:

- Record an interview using the audio from your speakers
- Upload an interview file (if you extract audio manually)
- Receive feedback and review how the Q&A detection and scoring work

> This is a great way to validate the full interview evaluation pipeline without recording your own voice.

## Android Testing

We support two types of testing via Google Play Console:

### 1. **Internal Testing** (invite-only)

This gives you early access to development builds before public release.  

If youâ€™re invited to the internal program, youâ€™ll see a screen like this:

<img 
  src="/images/community/internal-testing-01.png" 
  alt="Internal Test Program Confirmation"
  className="max-h-80"
/>

After accepting, you'll be redirected to the install page:

<img 
  src="/images/community/internal-testing-02.png" 
  alt="Install Page"
  className="max-h-80"
/>

> ðŸ“¥ **Click "Install"** to download the latest internal build and begin testing.

Once installed, youâ€™ll automatically receive updates as new versions become available.

### 2. **Open/Public Testing** (coming soon)

Google Play also supports **open testing**, where anyone with the link can try the beta version of the app.  

We plan to enable this after completing internal testing rounds.

## iOS Testing

iOS testing is managed through **TestFlight** (Apple's testing platform).  

We're currently preparing our app for external testers more details will be announced in [r/AiInterviewBuddy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AiInterviewBuddy/) once it's ready.
