## Testing the App

To ensure AI Interview Buddy is stable, user-friendly, and production-ready, we run **multiple testing programs** before each release.

You can help us test upcoming features on both **Android** and **iOS**.

## Test Scenario: Sample Interview Audio

To help you test the app quickly, we've prepared a short audio clip from a real interview posted on YouTube:

- [Watch the interview on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_i2RETG0yo): This allows to **Record an interview** using the audio from your speakers
- [Download the short interview extract](/images/testing/short-interview-extract.mp3): This is an mp3 file that contains 2 questions, good for quick tests
- [Download the full interview extract](/images/testing/full-interview-extract.mp3): This is an mp3 file that contains the full recording, ideal for performance tests

> This is a great way to validate the full interview evaluation pipeline without recording your own voice.
