AI Interview Buddy allows you to either **record live interviews** or **upload existing audio** (MP3, WAV, M4A).

Once processed, the system:

- Transcribes the audio using AI-based speech-to-text (STT)
- Identifies different speakers (you vs. interviewer)
- Groups questions and follow-ups into **Q&A pairs**
- Evaluates each answer using 7 key criteria
- Delivers detailed feedback to help you improve
