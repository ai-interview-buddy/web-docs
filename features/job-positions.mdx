The **Job Positions** feature lets you track every position you're applying to.

You can:
- Add a **public job URL**
- Or **paste the job description** directly if it's behind a login wall

> ðŸ“Œ Pasting the description is recommended when the original listing is password-protected or expires quickly.

Each job position serves as a workspace where you can:
- Attach interviews and CVs
- Generate a cover letter or email reply
- Create a LinkedIn message tailored to the role
