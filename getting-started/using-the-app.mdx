AI Interview Buddy helps you manage your job search and improve your interview performance with AI-powered tools.

---

## Getting interviews's detailed feedback 

You can **record** your interviews directly in the app or **upload** audio/video files. See: [Interviews](/features/interviews)  

Once uploaded, your interview is analysed and **detailed feedback** is provided — covering structure, clarity, impact and others.  

The methodology used to generate this feedback is explained here: [Evaluating Interview Performance](/methodology/evaluating-interview-performance)

## Managing job positions

You can register the **different job positions** you’ve applied to. See: [Job Positions](/features/job-positions)  

When creating a job position, you have two options:  
- Provide the **public URL** of the job listing  
- Or **copy and paste** the job description if it’s behind a password-protected portal  
> We recommend the copy/paste method for protected listings because AI Interview Buddy cannot access content hidden behind logins.

## AI-powered tools inside a job position

Within any job position, you can:

- Generate a tailored **cover letter** → [Generate a Cover Letter](/features/generate-cover-letter)  
- Ask AI to write a **reply to an email** → [Generate an Email Reply](/features/generate-email-reply)  
- Create a personalised **LinkedIn introduction message** → [Generate a LinkedIn Intro Message](/features/generate-linkedin-intro)  

These features use your CV and the job description to craft content you can send via LinkedIn or directly to a recruiter.

AI Interview Buddy can analyse your CV in multiple categories and provide a score for each area. See: [Career Profiles](/features/career-profiles)
