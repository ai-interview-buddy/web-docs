AI Interview Buddy allows you to **upload your CV in PDF format** to receive a detailed evaluation across five core categories.

> 📄 **Why PDF?**  
Recruiters and applicant tracking systems (ATS) expect resumes in PDF format.  
This ensures formatting consistency and accurate parsing.

### What is ATS and why does it matter?

**ATS** stands for _Applicant Tracking System_ - a type of software used by recruiters and companies to **automatically filter, parse, and rank CVs**.

Most employers, especially large organizations, receive **hundreds of applications per role**. To streamline the hiring process, they use ATS tools to:

- **Extract structured data** from your resume (e.g., name, experience, skills)
- **Scan for keywords** matching the job description
- **Score or discard** resumes based on formatting and content

> ⚠️ If your CV isn’t ATS-friendly, it may never reach a human recruiter even if you're a strong fit for the role.

That’s why formatting your resume for easy machine parsing is **essential** to increasing your chances of moving forward in the hiring process.

## Evaluation Categories

Your CV is scored in the following five areas:

![analyzing-cv](/images/methodology/analyzing-cv.png)

### 1. **ATS**

How well your CV can be **parsed by applicant tracking systems**.

- Uses standard fonts and clean formatting
- Avoids text in images or complex tables
- Proper section headers (e.g. “Work Experience”, “Education”)

> A well-structured ATS-friendly CV ensures your resume gets seen and not lost during automated filtering.

---

### 2. **Grammar**

Checks for **spelling, grammar, and syntax issues**.

- Proper verb tenses  
- No typos or incorrect punctuation  
- Consistent phrasing throughout

> Clean grammar boosts your professionalism and credibility.

---

### 3. **Pages**

Evaluates the **length** of your CV.

- Ideally 1 page (for junior roles) or 2 pages (for senior roles)
- Longer CVs may hurt readability or seem unfocused

> 🧠 Tip: Keep it concise - recruiters spend an average of **6–8 seconds** per resume on first scan.

---

### 4. **Structure**

Assesses your CV’s **organization and formatting consistency**.

- Logical section order (e.g., summary → experience → education → skills)
- Use of bold, spacing, and alignment
- Section completeness (missing education, missing dates, etc.)

> A clear structure makes your CV easier to read and navigate.

---

### 5. **Content**

Analyses the **quality and clarity** of your descriptions.

- Use of strong **action verbs** (e.g., “led”, “designed”, “shipped”)
- Inclusion of **measurable achievements**
- Avoidance of vague or generic phrases

> This is where you **show impact** - what you did, how, and why it mattered.

---

## Scoring Formula

Each category is scored from **0 to 10**, and a **weighted formula** is used to compute your final CV Score.

$$
\text{CV Score} = (ATS \times 0.30) + (Content \times 0.25) + (Structure \times 0.20) + (Grammar \times 0.15) + (Pages \times 0.10)
$$

> The final score is a number from 0 to 10, helping you identify improvement areas with the most impact.
