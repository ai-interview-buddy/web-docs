title: "Evaluating Interview Performance"
description: "Understand how AI Interview Buddy evaluates your interview answers using a structured, AI-assisted methodology."
---

AI Interview Buddy allows you to either **record interviews** directly using your device's microphone or **upload audio files** in most common formats (e.g., MP3, M4A, WAV).

Once an interview is uploaded, the system uses **AI-based speech-to-text (STT)** to transcribe the audio. This includes **speaker diarization** meaning it can distinguish between the candidate and the interviewer(s).

---

## Extracting Questions and Answers

After transcription, the system identifies individual **Q&A pairs**. It’s common for an interviewer to ask **follow-up questions**, so the system intelligently **groups sequences of related questions and answers** into single Q&A units for evaluation.

## Evaluation Criteria

Each Q&A pair is then evaluated across **seven key dimensions**. These are based on best practices in hiring and interview assessment:

### 1. Structured Response (Use of STAR Method)

Did the candidate organize their answer clearly and logically?

- Behavioral questions are ideally answered using the **STAR** model (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
- Technical answers should explain the problem and solution in a **step-by-step** manner.
- A good structure helps the evaluator follow the story and logic easily.

### 2. Relevance to the Question

Did the answer directly address the question asked?

- Strong answers **stay on topic** and answer all parts of a multi-part question.
- Examples chosen must be aligned with the intent of the question.
- Going off-topic or missing key elements reduces relevance.

### 3. Clarity and Conciseness

Is the response easy to follow and free from unnecessary rambling?

- Great candidates communicate in a **clear and focused** manner.
- Long-winded or vague responses are penalized.
- Clarity improves with structure and brevity.

### 4. Specificity and Detail

Does the candidate give **concrete details**, real examples, and avoid vague generalities?

- Strong answers include specific facts, tools used, data, names, and measurable outcomes.
- Vague or generic statements (e.g., “I worked hard”) hurt the credibility of the answer.

### 5. Actions and Personal Contribution

Does the candidate explain what **they** specifically did?

- Evaluators look for **individual ownership** of actions.
- Even in team settings, the candidate should highlight their **personal contribution**.

### 6. Results and Impact

Does the answer explain **what happened** as a result of their actions?

- Interviewers want to hear about **outcomes**, not just effort.
- Strong responses include **quantifiable results**, lessons learned, or meaningful change.

### 7. Skill/Competency Demonstration

Does the answer showcase the **skill or competency** the question is targeting?

- For example: teamwork, leadership, communication, technical knowledge, problem-solving.
- The answer should clearly demonstrate the **candidate possesses the desired quality**.

## Scoring and Final Evaluation

Each of the 7 criteria is scored on a **0–10 scale**.  
The average of these scores is used to determine the quality of the answer.

**Formula:**

> (ST + RV + CC + SP + AR + CY + SK) / 7 = Q&A Score


Then, the scores of all Q&A pairs in the interview are averaged to generate the final **Interview Score**.

---

## A Note on Subjectivity

While this scoring process helps **quantify interview answers** in a structured and fair way, it’s important to remember:

> **Interview performance is always somewhat subjective** - what’s considered a strong answer in one company or role may be seen differently elsewhere.

That said, by applying a **methodical approach** to structure, relevance, clarity, and impact, candidates can significantly **improve the quality of their answers**.

Successful candidates tend to **consistently demonstrate strength across these 7 dimensions**.
