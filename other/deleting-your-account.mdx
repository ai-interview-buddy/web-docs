## Why deleting your data matters

We understand that managing your digital footprint is important.  
If you no longer wish to use AI Interview Buddy, you have the right to request permanent deletion of your account and personal data.

---

## What gets deleted?

When your account is deleted, the following data is **permanently and irreversibly removed**:

- All interviews you recorded or uploaded
- All CVs and job descriptions you submitted
- All personalized content (cover letters, email replies, LinkedIn messages)
- All metadata and usage information stored in our systems

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This action is **irreversible**. Once your account is deleted, it **cannot be recovered**.

## How to request account deletion

Currently, there is **no in-app feature** to delete your account automatically.

To request deletion, please email us at:  
üì© [contact@aiinterviewbuddy.com](mailto:contact@aiinterviewbuddy.com)

We aim to process all requests within **5 working days**.

## Future improvements

We plan to add a self-service deletion feature in the app in a future release to make this process even smoother.

Thank you for using AI Interview Buddy.
